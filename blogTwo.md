## Entry 47 - The Silence Between Stars

The void has a way of talking to you when you've been alone long enough. Not in words, exactly, but in the steady hum of the life support systems and the occasional ping of micrometeorites against the hull. Today marks my 824th day since leaving the Proxima Centauri colony, and I'm beginning to understand why they called the early astronauts "space crazy."

The ship's AI keeps suggesting I maintain these logs for "psychological wellness," but I think we both know they're more than that. When you're the only human for 12 light-years in any direction, your thoughts become your only real companions.
Yesterday, I passed through a previously uncharted dust cloud. The particles scattered the starlight in ways I've never seen before â€“ creating rainbow-like halos that danced across my viewport for hours. I collected samples, of course. That's what I'm out here for. But sometimes I wonder if the real value of these missions isn't in the scientific data we gather, but in learning just how small we are.

The ship's garden is thriving, at least. My little slice of Earth in this metal cocoon. The tomatoes I planted three months ago are finally ripening. It's funny how something as simple as a red tomato can suddenly become the most beautiful thing you've ever seen when you've been staring at the black of space for so long.

I received a transmission from Control today. By the time they get my response, I'll be another half light-year away. They keep asking about the anomaly I detected near the Bernard's Star, but how do you describe something that defies our understanding of physics? Some things you have to see with your own eyes.

The coffee maker broke this morning. Of all the sophisticated equipment on this ship, it's the simple coffee maker that gives out. I've got three backup plans for engine failure, but no one thought to pack a spare coffee maker. I suppose that's what tea is for, though it's not the same.

Tomorrow I'll begin my approach to the Sirius binary system. The calculations show I'll be the first human to witness its light show up close. Just me, two massive stars, and enough wonder to fill an ocean.

Until next time, \
